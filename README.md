# BATWAVE BETA 0.2V
The "BatWave" project is inspired by the iconic system used by Batman, incorporating a
      series of advanced and
      interactive features, developed in C#. This all-in-one system is designed to be a powerful tool for both everyday
      use and entertainment, combining security, utility and customization.
      Functionalities
      Password and Password Change:
      Implementation of an authentication system that requires a password to access the BatComputer.
      Function to allow secure password change by the authenticated user.
      Roulette:
      A roulette mini-game where the user can try their luck, using concepts of random generation and game logic.
      System and User Name Change:
      Functions to customize the system and user name, immediately reflecting these changes in the interface.
      Real Time Date and Time:
      Continuous display of date and time updated in real time, using threads to maintain accuracy.
      Change of Visual Aspects:
      Ability to change the color of the console, allowing users to customize the interface to their preferences.
      Calculator:
      A built-in calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, integrating a mathematical expression parser.
      Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:
      Implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, with logic to determine the winner between the user and
      the computer.
      Greeting Recognition:
      Function that recognizes the time of day (morning, afternoon, night) and greets the user accordingly, using the
      current system time.
      Programming Aspects
      The project is developed using several advanced programming concepts in C#, including:
      Heritage:
      Using inheritance to create a structure of classes that share common behaviors, as base classes for different
      types
      of games and tools.
      Recursion:
      Implementation of recursive algorithms for functions that require repetitive calculations, such as when solving
      complex mathematical problems.
      Exception Handling:
      Use of try-catch blocks to manage errors and ensure that the system functions robustly and securely, especially in
      critical operations such as authentication and data manipulation.
      Classes and Objects:
      Creation of several classes to represent the system's functionalities, such as User, SystemSettings, and Game,
      promoting an organized and modular structure.
      Data storage:
      Implementation of methods to store and retrieve configuration data and user preferences, using text files and
      databases.
